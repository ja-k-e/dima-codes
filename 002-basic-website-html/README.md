#2. Basic Website: HTML

We are going to start creating a basic webpage. The most important component on a webpage is the HTML. HTML is the bare bones data on a page. The key to authoring *quality* HTML is to organize it as simply as possible. Sometimes that means a lot of organization, sometimes you hardly need anything. 

##HTML
For an introduction to HTML, see the [w3schools intro to html](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp).

In HTML, tags wrap content: `<tag>content</tag>`.

The most important thing to understand about HTML is that tags *describe* content. Although they have some influence on the default appearance in a web browser (for example, `h1` is big and bold), their purpose is description, not display. Display and style is CSS' responsibility.

##Lesson
- Duplicate the `example.html` file
- Name the new file `me-and-code.html`
- Open `me-and-code.html` in Chrome
- Replace each commented section with what the comment says
- Save and refresh the browser each time you make a replacement to see what you've done
- Commit the change with Git
- Sync your local Git repository with GitHub
