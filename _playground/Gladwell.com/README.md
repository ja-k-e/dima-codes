#Gladwell.com

I built a fake Malcolm Gladwell site in order to practice the `html` structure and `css` styling that I've learned up to this point. 

I've been deep in the Shay Howe lessons and felt that I was getting too sucked in to the reading and observing of information. I needed to solidify my current understanding of the topics by simply having some fun and building a site. 

This six page site is the culmination of what I understand about `html` and `css` at the moment.
