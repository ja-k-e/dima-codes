#Step 1: Humility
Get that pride out of your head now. It starts here. You can't learn if you obsess over how much you know. I wrote [Ignore what you've heard about writing "good code"](http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/blog/ignore-what-youve-heard-about-writing-good-code) with this idea in mind. Took me three years to get into the right mindset. It can start for you now.

#Step 2: Tooling
One of the most important things about development is your toolset. The following is a handful of tools you should use. For account-based tools, try and keep the usernames consistent. It makes networking easier in the long run and looks nice.

- A good email account for every account related to dev. For me a personal email worked out fine. For you, it may make more sense to have a different one. You'll get lots of updates.
- [CodePen Pro](http://codepen.io/pro/) (or free if you don't care about keeping things private). Becoming a part of the CodePen community is probably the best thing you'll ever do from a front-end perspective. It is an insanely useful tool but also a great place to learn and make friends.
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) best cross-discipline editor right now. You can score it for free.
    - [Package Control for Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/)
        - Easy installation of Sublime Text packages 
        - `cmnd + shift + P` to open Command Palette
        - Type `install package` until you see "Package Control: Install Package"
        - Type in the name of any package you found on the internet and it will be there.
        - Install [Afterglow Twilight Theme for Sublime Text](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-theme) to make things pretty
- [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/) is a fantastic terminal replacement. You'll need a Command Line Interface (CLI) once your projects are medium-scale and up.
- [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) a free markdown editor/previewer. Open `.md` files with it to see prettiness.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the best place to put your code. You won't be able to make your repositories private without paying for money but chances are most of your code is ok for open source. This repo is on GitHub. Contributing to other people's code is also a good thing to do. Don't worry, that will come later.
- [Git for Mac](http://git-scm.com/download/mac) the core Git functionality on your Mac. This is how you manage your project's changes. Run `git --version` in a CLI to see if it is already installed.
- [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com) is useful if you are more comfortable using a graphical user interface for Git instead of a CLI. This tool is free and makes it easier.
- [Twitter](http://twitter.com). Getting involved and following the right people helps you keep your finger on the pulse of whats going on in the world of development. Observe.

Installing some of these tools can be a pain. Don't worry, it makes sense eventually.
